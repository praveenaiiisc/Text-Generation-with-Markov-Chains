# Text-Generation-with-Markov-Chains
- Define Text as a Markov chains like this (eg: The cat ran over the dog.)

  - Now perform Matrix representation (rows are current state, columns are next state):

- Same Text apply for k-Word Markov Chain:

### Generated Text:
- from one word markov chain:

- from k-Word Markov Chain:
